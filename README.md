# Airbnb Analysis Project Overview

## Problem Statement
This project aims to analyze Airbnb data using MongoDB Atlas, perform data cleaning and preparation, develop interactive geospatial visualizations, and create dynamic plots to gain insights into pricing variations, availability patterns, and location-based trends. The objectives include:

- Establishing a MongoDB connection to retrieve the Airbnb dataset.
- Cleaning and preparing the dataset by addressing missing values, duplicates, and data type conversions.
- Developing a Streamlit web application with interactive maps showcasing the distribution of Airbnb listings.
- Conducting price and availability analysis, visualizing occupancy rates and demand fluctuations.
- Creating interactive visualizations and a comprehensive dashboard using Tableau or Power BI.

### Approach:

1. **MongoDB Connection and Data Retrieval:** Establish a connection to the MongoDB Atlas database and retrieve the Airbnb dataset for analysis.
2. **Data Cleaning and Preparation:** Address data integrity issues by handling missing values, removing duplicates, and converting data types.
3. **Geospatial Visualization:** Utilize Streamlit to create interactive maps for visualizing Airbnb listings across various locations.
4. **Price Analysis and Visualization:** Explore how pricing varies by location, property type, and season using dynamic visualizations.
5. **Availability Analysis by Season:** Visualize booking patterns and occupancy rates across different times of the year.
6. **Location-Based Insights:** Extract and visualize data for specific regions or neighborhoods to uncover unique trends.
7. **Interactive Visualizations:** Allow users to interact with the data through custom filters and exploration tools.
8. **Dashboard Creation:** Combine various visualizations into a single comprehensive dashboard in Tableau or Power BI.
